1. Heap is also called as binary heap.
2. It's a complete binary tree.
3. what is complete binary tree?
  Ans : A binary tree in which all levels all fully filled except possibly the last level
        and all the nodes in the last level are as left as possible.
4. Heap DS used for heap sort,and to implement priority queues.
5. If its complete,we can store it in array efficiently,bcx there will be no vacant space(gap).
6. other advantage is ,it is cache friendly and minimum possible height.
7. left=2*i+1   right=2*i+2    parent=(i-1)/2
8. What is the advantage of having complete binary tree in binary heap?
Ans : So that we can store binary heap in array without having extra space in b/w elements.

MIN HEAP:
-> complete binary tree
-> Every node has value smaller than its descendants.
