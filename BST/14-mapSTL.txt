1.Every item of map is a pair
2. two ways to insert
map<int,int> m;
m.insert({10,20});
m[5]=100;

for(auto &x:m)cout<<x.first<<" "<<x.second<<endl;

o/p: 5 100
    10 20

if we have 
m.insert({10,30})
then this line will completely ignored and remains {10,20}
cout<<m[30]<<endl;   //it insert key=30 wid value=0,so size of map increase

since we already have m[10]=30
we can change value of 10 using
m[10]=300      //   m.at(10)=300
but insert will not work
  
At operator ,it does same work as [] operator
but there is small diff,[] can insert if key is not present but m.at(key) can give out of range exception if key is not present
