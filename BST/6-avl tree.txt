---------------------AVL Tree--------------------
1.It is a BST(for every node,left subtree is smaller and right is greater)
2. It is balanced(for every node,diff b/w left and right heights does not exceed one)
Balance factor=|lh-rh|

Insert operation:
--> Perform normal BST Insert
--> Traverse all ancestors of the newly inserted node from the node to root
--> If find an unbalanced node ,check for any of the below cases
  1. left left
  2. right right
  3. left right
  4. right left


Ex. 20,15,5,40,50,18

height of Avl tree: 
h<c*log2(n+2)+b
c=1.4405
b=-1.3277
