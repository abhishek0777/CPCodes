1. Tree DS used to represent hierarchy of data set
2. Its a non-linear ds.
3. Terms in tree DS
   * node
   * root
   * leaf
   * child
   * parent
   * subtree
   * descendants -all the nodes which are part of subtree whose root is given node
   * ancestors
   * degree (no of childrens) 
4. Applications of tree
   -> TO represent hierarchial data
        |-> Organization structure
        |-> Folder structure
        |-> XML/HTML content (.JSON objects)
        |-> In OOP(inheritance)
   -> Binary search tree
   -> Binary heap
   -> B and B+ trees in DBMS(used for indexing)
   -> Spanning and Shortest path trees in computer networks
   -> Parse tree and expression tree
   -> Trie
   -> SUffix tree(to do fast searches in string)
   -> BIT
   -> Segment tree
5. Tree Traversal
   BFS(level order)
   DFS
    |-> Inorder
    |-> Pre order
    |-> Post order
6. Note that we can construct BT only when inorder traversal is given and one more traversal is also given.
